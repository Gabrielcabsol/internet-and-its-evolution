      <h2>softwares </h2>
     <p>
   In 1948, a computer scientist named Tom Kilburn created the first-ever piece of software. Kilburn and his colleague Freddie Williams built the Manchester Small-Scale Experimental Machine (SSEM) and used it to run Kilburn's program, which performed mathematical computations.

      but why teh softwares are so important you could ask, so i can tell you that softwares are essential for enabling computers and devices to perform a variety of tasks, from managing hardware to providing tools for users and developers. It has been developed by a range of individuals and organizations, each contributing to the evolution and functionality of modern computing systems taht can be:
      </p>  
        
      <p><strong>1. System Software</strong></p>

<p><strong>Operating Systems (OS):</strong> Manage hardware and provide services for other software. Examples include:</p>

<p>Windows: Developed by Microsoft, used in many personal and business computers.</p>
<p>macOS: Developed by Apple, used in Mac computers.</p>
<p>Linux: An open-source OS used in various environments, including servers and desktops.</p>

<p><strong>Device Drivers:</strong> Software that allows the operating system to communicate with hardware components. For example:</p>

<p>Printer Drivers: Enable communication between a printer and the computer.</p>
<p>Graphics Card Drivers: Allow the operating system to use a computerâ€™s graphics hardware effectively.</p>

<p><strong>2. Application Software</strong></p>

<p><strong>Productivity Software:</strong> Used for creating and managing documents, presentations, and data. Examples include:</p>

<p>Microsoft Office: Includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and more.</p>
<p>Google Workspace: Includes Docs, Sheets, Slides, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Media Software:</strong> For creating, editing, and managing multimedia content. Examples include:</p>

<p>Adobe Photoshop: For image editing and graphic design.</p>
<p>Adobe Premiere Pro: For video editing.</p>

<p><strong>Web Browsers:</strong> Used to access and navigate the internet. Examples include:</p>

<p>Minecraft: A sandbox game with creative and survival modes.</p>

<p><strong>3. Development Software</strong></p>

<p><strong>Programming Languages:</strong> Provide the tools to write software. Examples include:</p>

<p>Python: A versatile and widely-used programming language.</p>
<p>Java: A language used for building cross-platform applications.</p>

<p><strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):</strong> Provide tools for coding, debugging, and testing. Examples include:</p>

<p>Visual Studio: A popular IDE from Microsoft.</p>
<p>IntelliJ IDEA: An IDE for Java development.</p>

<p><strong>Compilers and Interpreters:</strong> Translate code into executable programs. Examples include:</p>

<p>GCC (GNU Compiler Collection): For compiling C, C++, and other languages.</p>
<p>Node.js: For running JavaScript code server-side.</p>

<p><strong>4. Utility Software</strong></p>

<p><strong>Antivirus Software:</strong> Protects against malware and viruses. Examples include:</p>

<p>Norton Antivirus</p>
<p>McAfee</p>

<p><strong>File Management:</strong> Tools for managing files and folders. Examples include:</p>

<p>WinRAR: For compressing and extracting files.</p>

      <h2>
       future and present 
        </h2>
   <.p>   in teh present the tecnology has evolved to much that now you can stay in talk with many people that are thousand of kilometers away. also the machines and internet have made our lifes easier providing us any info we can imagine at just one click
     </p>
      <p>
      you could imagine how far we are to create life and now we are more near than ever and an example can be the AI (artificial inteligence) that scientifics have developed to learn and make some functions like the famous chatgpt that is free and can make many things like images and provide us info as the server is updated, also robots in the present are robots for works that took many people to make like in fabrics now they can make it faster and more accurate.
    but also all this advances made many quistions and problems like waht if it happens like the movies terminator where an AI that reveal it self and attack humanity so there is where the robotics law made their appear, that are A robot may not injure a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm. A robot must obey orders given it by human beings except where such orders would conflict with the First Law. A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.
        
       </p> 
      <p>
        so in conclusion we can say that the advances that humanity has in the tecnology have to be observated to prevent any danger or even our own destruction.
