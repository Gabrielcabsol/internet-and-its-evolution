        <h1>The First Creators</h1>
        <p>The internet began in the late 1960s with ARPANET, a research project by the U.S. Department of Defense designed to link computers at various institutions. The development of TCP/IP protocols in the 1980s standardized network communication, leading to the expansion of ARPANET into the modern internet. Tim Berners-Lee's introduction of the World Wide Web in 1991 made the internet accessible to the public, enabling easy navigation and information sharing. The internet has since grown into a global network supporting a wide range of services and applications.</p>

        <p>After the internet was created in the U.S., several major changes occurred:</p>

        <p>Communication: Instant, global communication through email, online forums, and social media.</p>

        <p>Information Access: Immediate access to vast amounts of information via online resources and search engines.</p>

        <p>Economy: Rise of e-commerce, altering business practices and enabling global sales.</p>

        <p>Media: Transformation of traditional media with the growth of online news and streaming services.</p>

        <p>Work and Education: Increased viability of remote work and online learning.</p>

        <p>Culture and Society: Global sharing and access to diverse cultural content.</p>
        
        <h2>How Technology Could Be Used?</h2>
        <p>In the past some computers were developed; they had limited memory and processing power compared to todayâ€™s machines, and programming them required a deep understanding of their hardware.</p>
        
        <h2>Components</h2>
        <p>When the internet became available to everyone, some important components were given to the market.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Routers and Switches:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Routers:</strong></p>
        <p>Cisco 2500 Series: One of the first widely used routers in the 1990s, designed for enterprise environments.</p>
        <p>Netgear DG834: A home router that combined router and modem functionality into a single device, released in the early 2000s.</p>

        <p><strong>Switches:</strong></p>
        <p>Cisco Catalyst 5000 Series: Introduced in the 1990s, it was one of the first switches designed for high-performance networks.</p>
        <p>3Com SuperStack Series: Launched in the 1990s, it provided switching solutions for enterprise-level networks.</p>

        <p><strong>Servers:</strong></p>
        <p>IBM System/360: Introduced in 1964, it was one of the first mainframe systems to establish a universal computing architecture.</p>
        <p>DEC PDP-11: Released in 1970, a minicomputer used for both server tasks and data processing.</p>

        <p><strong>Modems:</strong></p>
        <p>Hayes Smartmodem 300: Introduced in 1981, it was one of the first modems to become an industry standard for data communication over telephone lines.</p>
        <p>U.S. Robotics Courier: A popular modem in the 1980s and 1990s, known for its reliability in high-speed connections for its time.</p>

        <h1>The Analog and Digital</h1>
        <p>All the computers functioned with radio signals that were.</p>
        <p>Analog computers were among the first types of computing devices. They were used for complex calculations involving physical processes, such as electrical circuits or fluid dynamics. Used for multiplication, division, and other calculations before digital calculators became widely available.</p>

        <p>The digital signal advance was very important with the addition of the shift to digital computing marked a significant advancement. Digital computers use binary code (0s and 1s) to represent data and perform calculations, which allows for more complex and precise processing.</p>
        <p>Also, the memory storage was a very important advance to make the computers have better functionality and allowed them to have better management.</p>
